# EJB JNDI Injection Demo
A small project to demonstrate JNDI and injection into beans and clients. This projects relates to the Accessing Session Beans exam topic.

## Running the project
Nothing fancy here. You can import the Maven project into your favourite IDE and run the main() method in the com.tobiascode.client.InjClient class. Or package it and run the jar, if you feel so inclined, not tested though.
