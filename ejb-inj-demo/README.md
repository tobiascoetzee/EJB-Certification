# EJB JNDI Injection Demo
A small project to demonstrate using Maven to setup a simple WAR file that contains a Stateless bean and Servlet that consumes the bean. This projects relates to the Accessing Session Beans exam topic.

## Running the project
Nothing fancy here. You can import the Maven project into your favourite IDE and run the main() method in the com.tobiascode.client.InjClient class. Or package it and run the jar, if you feel so inclined, not tested though.
